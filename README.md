## How it works:
    Each player picks their chosen shape on a count of three (or simultaneously).
    The outcomes are determined by a simple set of rules:
        Rock crushes scissors, but loses to paper.
        Paper covers rock, but loses to scissors.
        Scissors cut paper, but lose to rock.
    A player wins if their chosen shape beats the opponent's.
    If both players throw the same shape, it's a tie and the round is replayed.
